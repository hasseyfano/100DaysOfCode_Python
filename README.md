# 100DaysOfCode_Python
Realizing that I was stuck in a tutorial loop, I decided to switch to Angela's 100DaysOfCode challenge. This challenge encourages consistent coding for 100 days, which will undoubtedly result in improved skills. I plan to devote myself to this challenge, confident that it will help me break free from constantly relying on tutorials.

Embarking on this journey, I've encountered moments where I lost track and fell behind the daily coding schedule. However, I've come to understand that this challenge is more of a marathon than a sprint. It's not just about completing 100 days; it's about the continuous improvement and learning that happens along the way.

Despite the occasional setbacks, I remain committed to the process, knowing that the real value lies in the consistency and dedication to honing my coding skills. Each day is an opportunity to learn, grow, and overcome challenges. It's not just about reaching the finish line; it's about the progress made and the lessons learned throughout the journey.

I'm excited to see the transformation in my coding abilities as I persevere through this challenge. Let's keep pushing forward, embracing the learning curve, and celebrating the small victories along the way. Here's to the 100DaysOfCode challenge and the countless possibilities it holds for my coding journey. See you at the next milestone!
