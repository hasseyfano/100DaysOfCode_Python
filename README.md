# 100DaysOfCode_Python
Realizing that I was stuck in a tutorial loop, I decided to switch to Angela's 100DaysOfCode challenge. This challenge encourages consistent coding for 100 days, which will undoubtedly result in improved skills. I plan to devote myself to this challenge, confident that it will help me break free from constantly relying on tutorials. I'm excited to get started and see where this challenge takes me in my coding journey.
